# UTC_to_sec_converter

    # when you have csv about UTC information, you can use this code
    # if you have ros time, it is inaccurate
    # because yout time is your county or internal time
    # so, accurate time information is needed

    # if you want to practice this code, you convert bag file to csv
    # the csv file include time information
